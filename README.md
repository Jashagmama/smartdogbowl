## 🐶 Smart Dog Bowl — BLE Eating Detection System

This project implements a Bluetooth-enabled dog eating detection system using:

Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

Edge Impulse TinyML sound classification

Web Bluetooth UI for real-time monitoring

The system listens for dog chewing sounds, classifies them using an on-device ML model, and sends the probability over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a simple web-based UI that displays whether the dog is eating or has finished.
